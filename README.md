#ClockInApplication

##Notes

This application requires an online connection, and a webserver to connect to. 
Will be adding a server using MEAN stack application to work with this later.

## TODO

* Change the server to work with only url instead of requiring port number too.

* Change json parser to instead use GSON and a class model.

*Change the MVC design to use flux instead as this will simplify the connection using retrofit and observables.
